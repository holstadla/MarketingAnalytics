## k-means clustering on customer behavior of wine sales

A wine company sells many different types of wine. Their marketing department launced 32 initiatives over the past year to increase the sales of the wine (offer_info.csv). They also have data that shows which customers have responded to which of the 32 marketing initiatives (customers_offers.csv). The team wants to begin targeting their initiatives more precisely, so they can provide offers customized to groups that tend to respond to similar offers.

Performed k-means clustering in order to segment the customers into 3 groups. Their preferences showed that one segment strongly favors champagne/bubbly wine, another strongly prefers red wines, and the third has no preference. The marketing team can use this information to target champagn ads to one segment and red wine ads to the other in order to get favorable results.
